### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience in creating a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. Some key learnings include:

Implementing a mobile-first approach and using media queries to adjust the layout for larger screens.
Utilizing CSS Grid for creating a flexible and responsive layout.
Managing hover states for interactive elements to enhance user experience.
Using CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming across the project.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

Improving my JavaScript skills to add more interactivity to my projects.
Exploring CSS animations to create smoother transitions between states.
Learning more about accessibility to ensure my projects are usable by everyone.
Diving deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to create even more complex layouts.
